2,"The producer and consumer prices are a weighted average of prices collected for medical and non-medical consumption of cannabis. These prices are collected from the StatsCannabis crowdsourcing application and were projected backwards in time using historical models of cannabis pricing. Consumer prices are taken as reported in the StatsCannabis application, producer prices are estimated by removing the effect of margins for transportation and retailing activities using data from the Cannabis Economic Account."
